The whole project can easily be reproduced: the folder with raw data 
contains the two datasets downloaded from https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#world-bank-immunization,
renamed for convenience. full credits for the original data
go to the administrator of this webpage and worldbank. 
The cleaned csv files were created using the code that can be found in this repository. All of the scripts in python and stata
load data from links to this repository, which is public, so anyone can
directly run them.
