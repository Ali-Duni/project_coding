Hello,
welcome to my project for the course Coding for Economists. I am using two datasets
from Gabor's data analysis, both can be found under world-bank-immunization. both 
deal with immunization and child mortality, one of them contains data for individual
countries and the other one for regions. I used stata to analyse the country data 
and python for the regions. the codes, graphs and data for each can be found in
respective folders and subfolders
