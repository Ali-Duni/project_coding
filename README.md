Hello,
welcome to my project for the course Coding for Economists. I am using two datasets
from Gabor's data analysis, both can be found under world-bank-immunization. both 
deal with immunization and child mortality, one of them contains data for individual
countries and the other one for regions. I used stata to analyse the country data 
and python for the regions. the codes, graphs and data for each can be found in
respective folders and subfolders

The results show that there is a correlation between gdp, which is also usually
taken as a measure of economic growth, child mortality, and immunization.
More precisely, economic growth is positively correlated with immunizaton,
and both of them are negatively correlated with child mortality. These results
can be seen in the stata analysis. Moreover, graphs for the country level
show that these correlations also hold visually. Another graph showed that 
with each decade, the immunization grew slightly, and mortality dropped significantly

Moving to the level of regions, which was analysed using python, we can further see
that this trend holds for all regions over time. however, there are still huge differences, as subsaharan Africa
performs particularly poorly. Nevertheless, the general long-term trends seem to show
thankfully show positive convergence.
